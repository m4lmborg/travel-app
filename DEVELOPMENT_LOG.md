# LumiTrav Development Log

## Project Overview
LumiTrav is a web application designed to simplify and enhance group travel planning, coordination, and safety. It serves as a centralized platform for organizing trips, sharing itineraries, managing emergency contacts, and facilitating group communication.

## Current Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Frontend Base Setup (Completed)
- Created React application using create-react-app with TypeScript
- Implemented Material-UI for styling and components
- Set up React Router for navigation

#### Components Created:
1. **Layout Components**
   - `Navbar`: Responsive navigation with mobile menu support
   - Location: `/src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`

2. **Page Components**
   - `Home`: Landing page with feature highlights
   - `Login`: User authentication form
   - `Register`: User registration with emergency contact details
   - `GroupHub`: Travel group management interface
   - `ItineraryPlanner`: Trip planning and activity management
   - Location: `/src/components/pages/*`

### Phase 2: State Management Setup (Completed)
Implemented Redux Toolkit for state management with the following structure:

#### Store Configuration
- Location: `/src/store/store.ts`
- Combines reducers for auth, groups, and itinerary

#### Redux Slices
1. **Auth Slice** (`/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`)
   - User authentication state
   - Login/Register functionality (currently mock implementation)
   - Token management

2. **Group Slice** (`/src/store/slices/groupSlice.ts`)
   - Travel group management
   - Group creation and fetching (mock implementation)

3. **Itinerary Slice** (`/src/store/slices/itinerarySlice.ts`)
   - Activity management
   - CRUD operations for itinerary items (mock implementation)

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Backend Development (Next Priority)
1. **Server Setup**
   - Create Node.js/Express server
   - Set up MongoDB database
   - Implement JWT authentication
   - Create necessary API endpoints

2. **Database Schema**
   - User model
   - Group model
   - Activity model
   - Emergency contact model

3. **API Endpoints**
   - Authentication routes
   - Group management routes
   - Itinerary management routes
   - User profile routes

### Phase 4: Frontend-Backend Integration
1. **API Integration**
   - Replace mock API calls with real backend calls
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add loading states and error messages

2. **Authentication Flow**
   - Protected routes
   - Persistent login
   - Token refresh mechanism

### Phase 5: Feature Enhancement
1. **Real-time Updates**
   - Implement WebSocket connection
   - Real-time group chat
   - Activity updates notifications

2. **File Management**
   - Profile picture upload
   - Travel document storage
   - Photo sharing functionality

3. **Location Services**
   - Google Maps integration
   - Location sharing
   - Nearby places API

4. **Emergency Features**
   - Emergency contact system
   - Local emergency services information
   - Quick access safety features

## Dependencies Installed
- @mui/material
- @emotion/react
- @emotion/styled
- @mui/icons-material
- react-router-dom
- @reduxjs/toolkit
- react-redux

## Development Environment
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- React 18
- Material-UI v5

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm start`

## Current Limitations
- Using mock data instead of real backend
- Authentication not yet implemented
- No persistent data storage
- Missing real-time features

## Notes for Future Development
- Consider implementing error boundary components
- Add unit tests for components and Redux slices
- Implement proper form validation
- Add loading skeletons for better UX
- Consider implementing progressive web app features

## Security Considerations
- Implement proper JWT handling
- Add rate limiting for API calls
- Secure storage of sensitive information
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Add input sanitization

## Performance Considerations
- Implement code splitting
- Add proper caching mechanisms
- Optimize image loading
- Consider implementing service workers
